            <div class="mainAbout">
                <p>I am a Multi-Disciplined Language Analyst in the U.S Navy. This involves not just foreign language transcription and translation, but other disciplines as well, like scanning through mounds of information and writing reports on the important bits, all while following the pertaining laws, regulations and policies.</p><br>
                <p>I have around 6 months of self taught experience working as a Web Developer or Software Engineer, and I have gained many skills that are either meant for this career or translate well into it. I am currently working as a Software Development Intern for Elgia, Inc., and they have given me many opportunities to work with code, such as developing a CRUD api with nest.js and express.js. I have 4 months left of my internship, so many more opportunities await me!</p><br>
                <p>Language Analyst skills that have translated well into this field have been my ability to do in-depth analysis for finding solutions to problems. Extended use of a computer both at work and at home has also made me quick and efficient with overall navigation as well as increased my overall understanding of computer science.</p><br>
