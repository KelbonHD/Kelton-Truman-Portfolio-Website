                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Kelton Lamar Truman, and I am currently studying and trying to become proficient in software engineering. There's a lot I need to know, but I'm up to the task and have been working at it for months now.<br> I am currently studying at my own pace through Codecademy's Software Engineer course, and hope to have it done before I leave the Navy.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="before">
                <h3>Before Software Engineering</h3>
                    <h4>High School</h4>
                        <p>When I was in high school, I went through many different phases of what I wanted to do. Chemical Engineering, Automotive Repair, and yes, I even considered Web Development! Basically anything I was inherently good at, I latched onto, and wanted to pursue.<br> After seeing the price of college/university tuition, I wanted nothing to do with any of it! So what did I do? I joined the United States Navy.</p>
                    <h4>U.S Navy</h4>
                        <p>I initally went into the Navy hoping to become an ET, which stands for Electronic Technician. Basically, I would be working on anything and everything that has electricity surging through it on ships, carriers, you name it. I liked the idea of it, and though I would be good at it, but then my recruiter proposed an idea to me.<br> He saw my ASVAB scores, which are scores used to judge which rates you qualify for, and saw they were high enough that I qualified for another test. This test was the DLAB, a language capabilities test used to recruit linguists.<br><br> I decided I would take it, not thinking much of it. The lowest passing score was 104, and that was the score I got. That's when they offered me the new rate of CTI, standing for Cryptologic Interpretive Technician. They told me the benifits of such a rate, and I accepted in the end.</p>
                        <p>I worked my way through boot camp, and was assigned the Persian Farsi language, which I didn't know existed at the time. I went through the Defense Language Institue and graduated with a 3/2+/1+, with a 3/3/2 being the highest score.<br> After that I moved on to learn the operational side of my job, and have worked with NSA since mid 2019 doing things I really can't talk about! But, I've gained a lot of experience in cyber security and general computer knowledge on top of my already aquired skills.</p>
                    <h4>My Future After the Navy</h4>
                        <p>Currently, I'm still in the Navy. But I thought, being a little less than a year out from separation from the Navy, I should start looking towards the future. This was tricky, as I didn't think I had any skills to get me anywhere outside the Navy.<br> But then I remembered, back in highschool I had a huge aptitude for web development and coding in general. Programming and Web Development were the two classes I excelled above everyone constantly, and easily picked up on.<br> That is when I looked up the possibilites, and chose Software Engineering as the best fit for me.</p>

                <h3>Present Day</h3>
                    <h4>17 Months Out from Separation</h4>
                        <p>As of now, it's been about 6-7 months since I've started Software Engineering courses. It's been tricky, trying to balance my work life and other responsibilites on top of learning this. But I've been doing it, 30% through the Codecademy Software Engineering Course as of now.<br>I've mostly been using Codecademy as an introduction into software engineering, and as a "warm-up" for a more accredited, full-time course outside of the Navy. </p>
                        <p>I'm hoping to go through Thinkful, an accredited, 1 on 1 mentoring online class experience, where I can learn Software Engineering Mon-Fri full time, until course completion. After this, I'm hopeful to land a nice job to be able to support my significant other and I. That's all there is to it!</p>

                <h3>More About Me, Personally</h3>
                    <h4>My Hobbies</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I would say my main hobby is video games. I like non-competitive games for the most part, and use this as a way of relaxing on my own time</li>
                            <li>I love playing the piano. I recently started about a month ago as of June 6th, 2022, and I have learned a few songs! Slowly getting better by the day!</li>
                            <li>I enjoy working on my cars, but not during the summer! WAY too hot here! I prefer older-style japanese cars, and even own an import myself! Take a look!</li>
                            <li>I like doing a lot of the stuff people typically like doing, like watching movies, listening to music, and exercising as well!</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h4>What is My Personality Like?</h4>
                        <h5>The Good</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I think I am a truthful person. I speak my mind and let it be known how I feel, and Integrity in general is very important to me</li>
                                <li>I consider myself a very friendly and approachable person. I can read the room very well, and even though I can be akward sometimes, it won't be because I wasn't thinking before saying!</li>
                                <li>I am nearly impossible to offend. I know a lot of people are soft nowadays, but I am definitely not. If there is something about myself or my work that I need to be informed of, you can trust that I won't get beat up or angry about it! Also, direct insults don't work!</li>
                                <li>It takes quite a bit for me to get stressed. I am generally a very chill and relaxed person, and it takes something very big/important to get me stressed out.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h5>The Bad</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I'm not a very talkative person. This doesn't mean I'm anti-social, it just means I'm not going to talk your ear off! Is this a bad thing? Probably not, but I put it here due to the fact it could affect my ability to communicate with a team.</li>
                                <li>I am a relatively forgetful person in some regards. When it comes to names, I am especially bad! I have enough of a memory to remember how to code this site though, so I'd say it's good enough!</li>
                            </ul>
                    <h4>Other Things About Me</h4>

                                <p>I consider myself non-religious, but I'm very open and accepting to other peoples beliefs.</p>
                            <h5>My Diet</h5>
                                <p>I am most definitely not vegan/vegetarian, and will eat just about anything, except fruit flavored pies/bread products (banana bread being the only exception). I'm not entirely sure what it is about them, but I don't enjoy them!</p>
