                <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>My 5th Codecademy website, and 2nd unguided website.<br>
                    After the club website, my portfolio site you're currently browsing was next in line!<br>
                    This was the first project that I encountered scope creep, mainly because I wanted this site to be simple but perfect, and heavily overthought it.<br>
                    After finally pulling it together though, I finished it, and here we are!<br>
                    Some noteable things regarding this site is that it's the first time I've used Javascript for web development. It's also the first time I've made a website with multiple pages, and the first time I had the opportunity to take overall site design seriously.<br><br>
                    I am very proud of how the website has turned out, and I think it gets the job done perfectly!</p>

<!-- Thing to change on the stylesheet:
 - Probably the Size of the Image.
 - Description text size depending on how much is written.
